## num_images

### **Name**

**num_images**(3) - \[COLLECTIVE\] Number of images

### **Syntax**

```fortran
result = num_images(distance, failed)
```

### **Description**

Returns the number of images.

### **Arguments**

- **distance**
  : (optional, **intent(in)**) Nonnegative scalar integer

- **failed**
  : (optional, **intent(in)**) Scalar logical expression

### **Returns**

  Scalar default-kind _integer_. If **distance** is not present or has
  value 0, the number of images in the current team is returned. For
  values smaller or equal distance to the initial team, it returns the
  number of images index on the ancestor team which has a distance of
  **distance** from the invoking team. If **distance** is larger than
  the distance to the initial team, the number of images of the initial
  team is returned. If **failed** is not present the total number of
  images is returned; if it has the value _.true._, the number of failed
  images is returned, otherwise, the number of images which do have not
  the failed status.

### **Examples**

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_num_images
implicit none
integer :: value[*]
integer :: i

   value = this_image()
   sync all
   if (this_image() == 1) then
     do i = 1, num_images()
       write(*,'(2(a,i0))') 'value[', i, '] is ', value[i]
     end do
   endif

end program demo_num_images
```

### **Standard**

Fortran 2008 and later. With DISTANCE or FAILED argument, TS 18508 or later
