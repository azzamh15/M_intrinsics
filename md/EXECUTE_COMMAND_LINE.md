## execute_command_line

### **Name**

**execute_command_line**(3) - \[SYSTEM:PROCESSES\] Execute a shell command

### **Synopsis**
```fortran
    call execute_command_line( &
    & command [,wait] [,exitstat] [,cmdstat] [,cmdmsg] )
```
```fortran
     subroutine execute_command_line(command,wait,exitstat,cmdstat,cmdmsg)

      character(len=*),intent(in)  :: command
      logical,intent(in),optional  :: wait
      integer,intent(out),optional :: exitstat
      integer,intent(out),optional :: cmdstat
      character(len=*),intent(out),optional :: cmdmsg
```
### **Characteristics**

### **Description**

For **execute_command_line**(3) the **command** argument is passed to the
shell and executed. (The shell is generally **sh**(1) on Unix systems, and
cmd.exe on Windows.) If **wait** is present and has the value _\.false._,
the execution of the command is asynchronous if the system supports it;
otherwise, the command is executed synchronously.

The three last arguments allow the user to get status information. After
synchronous execution, **exitstat** contains the integer exit code of the
command, as returned by **system**. **cmdstat** is set to zero if the command
line was executed (whatever its exit status was). **cmdmsg** is assigned an
error message if an error has occurred.

Note that the system call need not be thread-safe. It is the
responsibility of the user to ensure that the system is not called
concurrently if required.

When the command is executed synchronously, **execute_command_line**
returns after the command line has completed execution. Otherwise,
**execute_command_line** returns without waiting.

### **Options**

- **command**
  : a default _character_ scalar containing the command line to be
  executed. The interpretation is programming-environment dependent.

- **wait**
  : (Optional) a default _logical_ scalar. If **wait** is present with the
  value .false., and the processor supports asynchronous execution of
  the command, the command is executed asynchronously; otherwise it is
  executed synchronously.

- **exitstat**
  : (Optional) an _integer_ of the default kind with **intent(inout)**. If
  the command is executed synchronously, it is assigned the value of
  the processor-dependent exit status. Otherwise, the value of
  **exitstat** is unchanged.

- **cmdstat**
  : (Optional) an _integer_ of default kind with **intent(inout)**. If an
  error condition occurs and **cmdstat** is not present, error termination
  of execution of the image is initiated.

  It is assigned the value **-1** if the processor does not support
  command line execution, a processor-dependent positive value if an
  error condition occurs, or the value **-2** if no error condition
  occurs but **wait** is present with the value false and the processor
  does not support asynchronous execution. Otherwise it is assigned
  the value 0.

- **cmdmsg**
  : (Optional) a _character_ scalar of the default kind. It is an **intent
  (inout)** argument.If an error condition occurs, it is assigned a
  processor-dependent explanatory message.Otherwise, it is unchanged.

### **Examples**

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_exec
implicit none
   integer :: i

   call execute_command_line("external_prog.exe", exitstat=i)
   print *, "Exit status of external_prog.exe was ", i

   call execute_command_line("reindex_files.exe", wait=.false.)
   print *, "Now reindexing files in the background"
end program demo_exec
```
### **Note**

Because this intrinsic is making a system call, it is very system
dependent. Its behavior with respect to signaling is processor
dependent. In particular, on POSIX-compliant systems, the SIGINT and
SIGQUIT signals will be ignored, and the SIGCHLD will be blocked. As
such, if the parent process is terminated, the child process might not
be terminated alongside.
