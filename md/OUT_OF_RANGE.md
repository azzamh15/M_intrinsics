## out_of_range

### **Name**

**out_of_range**(3) - \[TYPE:NUMERIC\] Whether a value cannot be converted safely.

### **Synopsis**
```fortran
    result = out_of_range (x, mold [, round])
```
```fortran
     elemental logical function(x, mold, round)

      TYPE,kind=KIND),intent(in) :: x
      TYPE,kind=KIND),intent(in) :: mold
      logical,intent(in),optional     :: round
```
### **Characteristics**

   where TYPE may be _real_ or _integer_ of any available KIND.

### **Description**

   **out_of_range**(3) determines whether a value **x** can be converted
   safely to a _real_ or _integer_ variable the same type and kind as
   **mold**.

### **Options**
   - **x**
     : a scalar of type _integer_ or _real_ to be tested for whether
     it can be stored in a variable of the type and kind of **mold**

   - **mold**
     : shall be an _integer_ or _real_ scalar. If it is a variable, it
     need not be defined, as only the type and kind are queried.

   - **round**
     : flag whether to round the value of **xx** before validating it as
     an integer value like **mold**.

     **round** can only be present if **x** is of type
     _real_ and **mold** is of type _integer_.

### **Result**

From the standard:

   Case (i):     If MOLD is of type integer, and ROUND is absent or
                 present with the value false, the result is true
                 if and only if the value of X is an IEEE infinity or
                 NaN, or if the integer with largest magnitude that lies
                 between zero and X inclusive is not representable by
                 objects with the type and kind of MOLD.

   Case (ii):    If MOLD is of type integer, and ROUND is present with
                 the value true, the result is true if and only
                 if the value of X is an IEEE infinity or NaN, or
                 if the integer nearest X, or the integer of greater
                 magnitude if two integers are equally near to X, is not
                 representable by objects with the type and kind of MOLD.

   Case (iii):   Otherwise, the result is true if and only if the value
                 of X is an IEEE infinity or NaN that is not
                 supported by objects of the type and kind of MOLD,
                 or if X is a finite number and the result of rounding
                 the value of X (according to the IEEE rounding mode if
                 appropriate) to the extended model for the kind of MOLD
                 has magnitude larger than that of the largest finite
                 number with the same sign as X that is representable
                 by objects with the type and kind of MOLD.

   NOTE

   MOLD is required to be a scalar because the only information
   taken from it is its type and kind. Allowing an array MOLD would
   require that it be conformable with X. ROUND is scalar because
   allowing an array rounding mode would have severe performance
   difficulties on many processors.

### **Examples**

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_out_of_range
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : int8, int16, int32, int64
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : real32, real64, real128
implicit none
integer            :: i
integer(kind=int8) :: i8, j8

    ! compilers are not required to produce an error on out of range.
    ! here storing the default integers into 1-byte integers
    ! incorrectly can have unexpected results
    do i=127,130
       i8=i
       j8=-i
       ! OUT_OF_RANGE(3f) can let you check if the value will fit
       write(*,*)i8,j8,' might have expected',i,-i, &
        & out_of_range( i,i8), &
        & out_of_range(-i,i8)
    enddo
    write(*,*) 'RANGE IS ',-1-huge(0_int8),'TO',huge(0_int8)
    ! the real -128.5 is truncated to -128 and is in range
    write(*,*) out_of_range (  -128.5, 0_int8)         ! false

    ! the real -128.5 is rounded to -129 and is not in range
    write(*,*) out_of_range (  -128.5, 0_int8, .true.) ! true

end program demo_out_of_range
```

Results:

```text
  >  127 -127  might have expected         127        -127 F F
  > -128 -128  might have expected         128        -128 T F
  > -127  127  might have expected         129        -129 T T
  > -126  126  might have expected         130        -130 T T
  > RANGE IS         -128 TO  127
  > F
  > T
```
