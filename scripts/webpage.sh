# Activating the pre-commit hooks for Black and Pylint:
# This assumes that you already have a cloned the main branch of this repository. Steps to activate the pre-commit hooks are:
# Make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of the repository.

pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

    Activate the pre-commit hooks:

pre-commit install
###################################################################################
# Now, the precommit hooks have been successfully been installed into your clone.
exit

Steps to debug/resolve issues which prevent the commit due to pre-commit hooks:

    if pylint causes the issues in commiting to the repo, and it seems mandatory to skip the pre-commit hooks use:

SKIP=pylint git commit -m"my commit"`

    if black causes the issues in commiting to the repo, and it seems mandatory to skip the pre-commit hooks use:

SKIP=black git commit -m"my commit"

Translating via weblate

Translations can be contributed via weblate.

Translation status
Update or add translations

The documentation uses the sphinx-intl utility to generate websites for multiple languages. It generates *.po files, which contain the original sentences and a placeholder for translations.

To update translations run

python3 intl.py

if you only want to update a single translation add LANGUAGES=de to the command. This command will generate the message catalog (*.pot) and update the *.po files in the locale directory of the respective translations. Then edit the *.po files, e.g. locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/index.po. In the *.po files are paragraphs like

#: ../../pages/index.md:16
msgid "Package manager and build system for Fortran"
msgstr ""

The first line describes the file and line where to find the original text.

The second line is the original text. Don't edit this line, edit the original document instead.

The third line is meant for the translation.

To continue a long string in another line, simply close the string in the current line with " and open another one in the line underneath. E.g.

msgstr "This is "
"one string"

don't forget a space between 'is' and 'one'

After adding or updating translations build the documentation as described above.
