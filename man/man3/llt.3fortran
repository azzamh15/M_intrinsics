.SH NAME
\fBllt(3f) \fP- [FORTRAN:INTRINSIC:CHARACTER] Lexical less than
\fB
.SH SYNTAX
result = \fBllt\fP(string_a, string_b)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Determines whether one string is lexically less than another string,
where the two strings are interpreted as containing ASCII character
codes. If the String A and String B are not the same length, the
shorter is compared as if spaces were appended to it to form a value
that has the same length as the longer.
.PP
In general, the lexical comparison intrinsics LGE, LGT,
LLE, and LLT differ from the corresponding intrinsic
operators .ge., .gt., .le., and .lt., in
that the latter use the processor's character ordering (which is not
ASCII on some targets), whereas the former always use the ASCII
ordering.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B string_a
Shall be of default CHARACTER type.
.TP
.B string_b
Shall be of default CHARACTER type.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns .true. if string_a <= string_b, and .false.
otherwise, based on the ASCII ordering.
.SH STANDARD
[[FORTRAN 77]] and later
.SH CLASS
[[Elemental procedure|Elemental function]]
.SH SEE ALSO
