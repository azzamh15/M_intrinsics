  Results:

          angle of incline(radians) =    2.5002604899361139E-002
          angle of incline(degrees) =    1.4325437375665075
          percent grade=   2.5000000000000000

  The percentage grade is the slope, written as a percent. To calculate the slope you divide the rise by the run. In the example
  the rise is 1.25 mile over a run of 50 miles so the slope is 1.25/50 = 0.025.  Written as a percent this is 2.5 %.

  For the US, two and 1/2 percent is generally thought of as the upper limit. This means a rise of 2.5 feet when going 100 feet
  forward. In the US this was the maximum grade on the first major US railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio. Note curves increase the
  frictional drag on a train reducing the allowable grade.
